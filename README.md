# Pandas Challenge

For this challenge, I used two csv raw data to compute distric-wide standardized test results. In raw data, there are every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 

## District Summary
In District Summary, it shows total schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading score, % passing rate for math and reading, and % overall passing on both math and reading. 

## School Summary
In School Summary, it shows each school name and school type (charter or district). It also shows total students, total school budget, per capita student budget by each school. From previous raw data, average math and reading score, % passing rate of math and reading, and % overall passing rate is computed for each school. 

## Highest-Performing Schools and Lowest-Performing Schools
In this summary, 5 schools with highest % overall passing rate (both math and reading) is listed. Below this, there is 5 schools with lowest % overall passing rate (both math and reading)

--From this summaries, it seems CHarter schools outperforms on % overall passing rate compared to District shools, since all of top 5 highest-performing school is Charter School. On the contrary, all 5 lowest-performing schools were District School. 

## Math Score by Grade 
In this summary, Math score for each grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade) of each school is listed. 

## Reading Score by Grade
In this summary, Reading score for each grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade) of each school is listed. 

## Scores by School Spending
In this table, each school performance based on average spending per student (<$585, $585-630, $630-645, $645-680) is listed. 
From this table, lower spending ranges per student (<$585) has higher average math score and higher average reading score. 
% Overall passing rate on both math and reading is higher to lower spending range per student, compared to higher spending ranges per student. 
From this table, average spending per student does not guarantee higher passing rate on both math or reading subjects. 

## Scores by School Size
In this table, each school performance based on school size (small, medium, large is listed. 
Clearly, Large school with total student number between 2000 to 5000 has significant lower % passing rate for both math and reading subject compared to small school size (total number of student < 1000). This is very clear on average math and reading score, where large school size significantly has lower score compared to small school size. 

## Scores by School Type 
In this table, each school performance based on school type (District or Charter) is listed.
As mentioned before, Charter school outperformed District school. In all average math and reading score, % passing rate of math and reading is higher on Charter school, compared to District School.

## Conclusion
1. Charter School student has higher average math and reading score. Therefore, Charter School student has higher passing rate on both math and reading. 
2. Samller school with total student less than 1000 has higher average math and reading score. Therefore, students from smaller size school has higher passing rate on both math and reading. 
3. Schools that has lower spending ranges per student (<$585) has higher average math and reading score. Compared to students from higher spending ranges per student ($645-680), students from schools with lower spending ranges per students has higher passing rate on both math and reading.
